## [Release 5.6.0](https://github.com/ChaiScript/ChaiScript/releases/tag/v5.6.0 "Release 5.6.0")

### Changes since 5.5.1
* Throw exception on integer divide by 0
* Add optional type specification to function declarations
   
  ```
  def func(int i, j, double k) {
    // i must be an int.
    // j can be anything
    // k must be a double
    // normal conversion rules still apply
  }
   ```
* Many minor fixes for compiler warnings
* Add support for `std::future` and `std::async`
  ```
  var f := async(someFunction);
  var f2 := async(someFunction2);

  // someFunction and someFunction2 are running in parallel now
  f.get();
  f2.get();
  ```
* Fully support r-value returns, supporting move-only objects and reducing object copies
